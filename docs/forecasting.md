# Forecasting

While this framework isn't designed for forecasting, we integrate with PyTorch Forecasting as an example of how forecasting models can directly plug into the framework.

Forecasting models for particular set of entities can be tested in simulation. These models are triggered when data is required from various entities while performing optimziation and forecasting models can intervene in any of the entities while using the built-in data provided with this framework.
