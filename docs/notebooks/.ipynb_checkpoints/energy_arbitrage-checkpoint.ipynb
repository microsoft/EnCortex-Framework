BatteryArbitrageScenarioEnv is one of the supported environments by EnCortex. Check here to know more details. The step_time_difference is another user-configurable parameter which says about the optimization step to be taken. For MILP, the optimum result comes when the step time difference is set similar to the timestep parameter. For Reinforcement Learning, it is a mandate to set it equal to the timestep else the action size increases which leads to erroneous learning by the agents."

    "The plot below gives a clear indication of how the state of charge of the battery (green coloured line charts for multiple optimizers if selected) varies with the respective variations in Price (yellow plot) and carbon emissions (red plot). Based on the objective selected by the user, the price and carbon variations play a key role in deciding the charging and discharging schedules. For example, a common inference drawn from the schedules plot is when the prices are high, the battery discharges, whereas when the prices are low, the battery tends to charge from the utility grid, thus maximizing the profit for the consumer. Similar conclusion can be drawn for carbon arbitrage as well. "
